# **PhD Physics Interview PRL Ahmedabad**

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Astrophysics

## Interview Format:
**Number of Panel Members:** 6 
**Mode:** Offline-Inperson Interview  
**Rounds:** 1 


## **Questions**

1. **Introduce yourself.**

   * What did you do during your gap year?

2. **Name the topics that you are interested in.**

   * *(I mentioned Quantum Mechanics and Electrodynamics)*

3. **Draw the potential for a harmonic oscillator.**

   * Write the Schrödinger equation and energy eigenvalues for it.
   * How do the energy eigenvalues depend on the parameters of the spring?
   * Now take the case of a truncated harmonic oscillator ( $V \to \infty$ for $x < 0$ ).

     * How would the new energy eigenstates look like?
     * What will be the new energy eigenvalues?
     * Would the energy eigenvalue of the ground state of the truncated case be the same as that of the original one?

4. **Consider a closed system containing identical charged species — take electrons for example.**

   * Prove that it wouldn’t radiate electric dipole radiation.

     * *(I told them that since there are no external perturbations, there would be no charge separation, so the electric dipole moment will be zero and hence there will be no radiation. They told me that's not the case.)*
     * *(They gave a hint: if the system contained both electrons and protons, it would radiate — that is true, as in that case there would be electric dipoles. But I still wasn't sure how to relate that to the previous case, since the reasoning I gave was said to be wrong.)*

5. **Do you know about the thermonuclear reaction inside the core of the Sun?**

   * Write the p-p chain reaction with proper notation.
   * Why would two protons come close to form a deuteron even though they repel due to electrostatic repulsion?
   * Is gravitational pull enough to support this process?
   * Calculate the order of electrostatic potential energy and thermal kinetic energy.
   * Even when the order of thermal KE is keV and that of electrostatic potential is MeV, how can this reaction even be possible?

     * *(Not in classical sense, but possible in quantum sense because of quantum tunneling.)*

6. **What is blackbody radiation?**

   * Can the Sun be considered a blackbody?
   * Why is it called a blackbody even when it is not black visually?

7. **Tell us about your dissertation project in M.Sc.**

   * *(Mine was in atmospheric physics related to atmospheric pollutants.)*
   * How would the distribution of pollutants with height look if you consider a simple Boltzmann distribution?
