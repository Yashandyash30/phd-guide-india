- **Mode:** Online Interview  
- **Rounds:** 1 

## Questions:
1. **Asked me to give my basic introduction.**
    
2. **Told me to plot the sin(1/x) graph. How would it look like in the positive x-domain.**
    
    - _Follow-up:_ Interpretation of the graphâ€™s behavior near zero.
        
3. **Asked me if I had read through the various PhD topics that were given beforehand through mail, and which topic I was interested in.**  
    _(In my case, I mentioned Time-Domain Astrophysics and Gravitational Astrophysics.)_
    
4. **Inquired about my Master's specialization (Space Physics) and the subjects I had in that course.**  
    _(Astrophysics Observation and Instrumentation, Solar Physics, and Atmospheric Physics)_
    
5. **Asked me about various instrumentation techniques used.**
    
6. **How different measurement techniques are required for observing different wavelength signals.**
    
7. **Asked what things we have to keep in mind while using an instrument on the ground and in space.**
    
8. **Asked: If I take a PMT for example, how would different factors affect it in space.**
    
9. **Asked me about blackbody radiation. How does its graph look like? Plot the graph.**
    
10. **What each axis represents, and what does the total area under the curve represent.**
    
11. **How the graph looks at different temperatures, and whether the area under the curve changes with temperature or remains the same.**
