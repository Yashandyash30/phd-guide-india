# **PhD Physics Interview IISER PUNE**

**Number of Panel Members:** 3  ( in first round ) & 2 ( in Second Interview)
**Mode:** Oral Interview  
**Rounds:** 2 (Technical + Discussion)


##  **Round 1: Technical Questions**

1. **Electric Field at the Center of a Polygon**
    
    - What is the electric field at the center of a regular polygon with equal charges at each corner **except one**?
        
2. **Electric and Magnetic Field Coupling in Special Relativity**
    
    - According to Special Theory of Relativity, how can we say that electric and magnetic fields are coupled?
        
3. **Current-Carrying Loop and Bar Magnet Analogy**
    
    - How is a current-carrying circular loop similar to a bar magnet?
        
    - What is the direction of the magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying loop?
        
4. **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator:**
    
    - a. Draw the energy level diagram of a quantum harmonic oscillator.
        
    - b. How can the system be excited from the ground state to a higher energy state?
        
    - c. Write down the Hamiltonian for such an interaction (e.g., due to an external perturbation).
        
    - d. Why does the system transition **only to the first excited state** from the ground state, and not to higher excited states directly?
        
        - Using Fermi’s Golden Rule, derive the **selection rules** for allowed transitions.

##  **Round 2: Research Interests and Conceptual Discussion**

1. **Research Interests & Gap Year Activities**
    
    - What is your area of research interest?
        
    - What did you pursue during your gap year?
        
    - Would you be flexible in working on topics like **instrumentation** or **experimental high-energy physics**, apart from **observational astronomy**?
    
    - Are you interested in electronics. Did you ever made projects using Raspberry Pi etc.
        
2. **Recent Space Mission**
    
    - Name any recent space mission you are particularly interested in.
        
        - _( Told About Aditya L1 Mission Led to discussion on Lagrange Points also i did workshop on it conducted by ARIES)_
            
3. **Lagrange Points: Conceptual Understanding**
    
    - a. Is the **L1 Lagrange point** stable or unstable?
        
    - b. Does the analysis of Lagrange points involve a **two-body** or **three-body** problem?
        
        - Follow-up: Why is it called a **restricted three-body problem**?
            
    - c. Can a **two-body problem** have Lagrange points?
        
        - (Expected Answer: **No**, as two-body problems are exactly solvable and produce conic section orbits. Lagrange points arise in the context of restricted three-body problem)
            
4. **Analogy between Gravitational and Electric Forces**
    
    - What are the similarities between electric force and gravitational force?
        
        - (Hint: Both are inverse-square central forces, follow superposition, etc.)
        - _( Wanted to know whether Earnshaw's Theorem can be applied in both cases)_
            
5. **Earnshaw’s Theorem**
    
    - a. What is Earnshaw’s Theorem?
        
    - b. Is Earnshaw’s Theorem valid for both **electric charges** and **gravitational masses** in the **static case**?
        
    - c. Do **Lagrange points** (especially **L4** and **L5**, which are stable) violate Earnshaw’s Theorem?
        
        - (Hint: No, because Earnshaw's theorem applies to **point charges in static equilibrium**, while Lagrange points arise due to **dynamic equilibrium** in a rotating frame.)

## **Preparation Tips & Recommendations**

1. **Review Workshops and Projects You Mention**
    
    - Be ready to explain **any workshop, training, or course** you've listed in your CV.
        
    - Know the **underlying physics** and **applications** related to the topic.
        
2. **Refer to Standard Textbooks**
    
    - For theory-based questions, rely on **standard texts** such as:
        
        - _Griffiths – Introduction to Electrodynamics_ (for topics like Earnshaw’s theorem, multipoles, and electrostatics)
        
3. **Build Conceptual Connections**
    
    - Practice **relating topics** across different fields:
        
        - e.g., How STR affects E and B fields
            
        - How selection rules in quantum mechanics mirror conservation principles
            
        - Classical vs quantum analogies (current loop and bar magnet, etc.)
        
        -  Similar Structure for Gravitational and Electric Forces.
            
4. **General Awareness and Stay Updated**

	- Be prepared for interdisciplinary questions.
    - Regularly follow updates on:
        
        - Ongoing Indian and global missions, observatories
            
        - **Nobel Prize-winning research** in Physics
            
        - Breakthroughs in **astronomy, cosmology** and **instrumentation**
