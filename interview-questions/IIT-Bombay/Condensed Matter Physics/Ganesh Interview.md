# IIT Bombay – Condensed Matter Physics Interview

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Condensed Matter Physics

## Interview Format:
- **Number of Panel Members:** 3-4  
- **Mode:** Online Interview  
- **Rounds:** 1  
- **Written Test:** No

## Questions:

The interview began with the panel asking me to introduce myself. I shared details about my education, the exams I had cleared, and mentioned that I completed my M.Sc. in 2021. They then inquired about what I had been doing since, and I told them that I have been teaching Physics to Class 11 and 12 students at a coaching institute.

They asked me which chapter I enjoy teaching the most. I replied, _“Structure of Atom,”_ so they proceeded to ask a few basic questions from that chapter.

Afterward, they shifted the discussion to **semiconductors**, and asked the following questions:

1. What is a band gap?
    
2. Given certain conditions, which material would you choose to make an LED, and why?
    
3. What is the difference between a **direct** and **indirect** band gap?
    
    - Why does the electronic transition in an indirect band gap occur from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and not between other points on the energy curve?
        

The interview concluded after this.  
Unfortunately, I was not selected.
