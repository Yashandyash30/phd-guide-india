# IIT Bombay - PhD Interview (Physics)

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: HEP-Th

## Interview Format:
- **Number of Panel Members:** 3-4  
- **Mode:** Online Interview  
- **Rounds:** 1 

## Questions:
1. **What outcome will you get if you measure the spin in x direction of a spin half particle with its spin along z direction. What happens when the spin is oriented along a random direction making angle $\theta$ with the z-axis. What is the rotation matrix for a spin half particle. Write it in closed form.**

2. **Write down the Lagrangian for three masses m, M and m connected by two springs, and derive the equation of motion. What are its modes of oscillation. What are normal modes. Will a general oscillation be a superposition of normal mode oscillations or will it have other frequencies too.** 

> Tip: Getting into IIT Bombay almost exclusively requires you to have a JRF as far as I understand.
