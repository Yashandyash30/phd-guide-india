##  Questions

1. **What is the Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization condition. Derive the energy spectrum of Harmonic Oscillator based on this. Also derive the spectrum of $x^4$ potential using the same.**

2. **Write the Lagrangian for a pendulum constrained to a 2D plane, whose string has been replaced by a spring. Find the equations of motion. Find the effective potential for the system. If this pendulum is kept in contact with a heat bath, does it follow the equipartition principle.**
