###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Astrophysics

## Interview Format:
**Number of Panel Members:** 7-8 
**Mode:** Offline-Inperson Interview  
**Rounds:** 1 

##  Questions

1. **Asked to give my basic introduction and what various workshops and projects I had done.**
    
2. **Then they asked questions mostly related to the workshops I attended.**
    
3. **What are the various wavelengths in electromagnetic radiation, which are absorbed and which reach the Earth's surface? How would we measure those different wavelengths?**
    
4. **Suppose there is a star radiating power (take the Sun) and it is radiating energy towards the Earth. How would the temperature of the Earth vary? Will it increase infinitely or reach equilibrium?**
    
5. **Derive the equation for determining the equilibrium temperature of the Earth. Take a simplistic model.**
    
6. **They asked about the process behind northern lights and how the charged particles emitted from the Sun interact with the atmosphere and magnetic field of the Earth.**
    
7. **They asked about the trajectory of charged particles around the Earth's magnetic field.**
    
8. **Told me to draw the magnetic field of the Earth and show the trajectory of charged particles. Also, derive the condition under which charged particles will enter the Earth's atmosphere (concept of magnetic mirror and pitch angle).**
    
9. **Asked a question in thermodynamics: Which quantity remains constant during a phase change?**
    
10. **Write the equation for the change in entropy during the conversion of ice to vapor.**
    
11. **What is the second law of thermodynamics? What does it state (about change in entropy and heat)?**
    
12. **Assume a closed system containing a homogeneous gas. If I decrease the volume, what would happen?**
    
13. **How does the temperature of the system increase? What happens at the interparticle level?**
    
14. **Draw the graph of 1x3âˆ’1x4\frac{1}{x^3} - \frac{1}{x^4}.**
