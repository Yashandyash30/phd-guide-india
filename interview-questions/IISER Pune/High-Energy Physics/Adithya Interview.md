# **PhD Physics Interview - IISER PUNE**

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: High Energy Physics

## Interview Format:
**Number of Panel Members:** 3  ( in first round ) & 2 ( in Second Interview)
**Mode:** Offline-Inperson Interview  
**Rounds:** 2 (Technical + Discussion)

First round is a general round. It doesn't matter what field you are in interested in, they will ask questions from everything. 


##  **Round 1: General Questions**

I had mentioned that I was interested in HEP, and had done some computational work in the past, so they started off with a computational question

1. **Algorithm for Primes**
    
    - Write an algorithm for finding the prime numbers less than $n$, and optimize it as much as possible.
        
2. **Why Quantum Field Theory is needed, and why QM is not sufficient**
    
    - I answered that the probabilities are conserved in QM and therefore cannot explain the creation and annihilation of particles as required. Then they went on to ask me to derive the continuity equation that is associated with the probability.
        
3. **Explain how a speaker works**
    
    - There is usually one experiment related question (depending on your panel), and they asked me to explain how a speaker works.
        
4. **Measuring Magnetic Field**
    
    - Suppose there is a region with constant magnetic field, design an apparatus that you can use to measure the strength of the magnetic field.

##  **Round 2: Research Interests and Conceptual Discussion**

1. **Research Interests & Gap Year Activities**
    
    - What is your area of research interest?
        
    - What did you pursue during your gap year?
        
    - Would you be flexible in working on topics like **experimental high-energy physics** or do you want to work only in **theory**?
        
2. **Scalar Field Theory**
    
    - Write down the most general Lagrangian for a scalar field theory in (1+1) dimensions. 

    - Deduce, till what order of terms can be kept in the Lagrangian. 

    - Draw all possible 4-point diagrams with one or more loops.

3. **Electric Field**

    - Draw the potential profile for a charged annulus. Find out where the equilibrium points of the potential are.

4. **Delta Function Potential**

    - Find the constraints on a general wavefunction for a particle in delta function potential. 

5. **Master's Thesis**

    - Explain on what topic you did your master's thesis, and what was it about.

## **Preparation Tips & Recommendations**

I have given the interview at IISER Pune twice, and both the times the experience was wildly different. So I can't give a general preparation tip.
