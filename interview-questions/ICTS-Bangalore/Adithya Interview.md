# ICTS Bangalore - PhD Interview (Physics)

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Physics

## Interview Format:
- **Number of Panel Members:** 3   
- **Mode:** In-person Interview  
- **Rounds:** 1 

The panel consisted of researchers working in cond mat and stat phys although I had applied in strings. So assume that the panel would be a general one and not field specific.

## Questions:
1. **Calculate the expectation value of $\hat{x}(0)\hat{x}(t)$ in the first excited state of Harmonic Oscillator.**

2. **Draw the graph of $x \log x$. Detail its behaviour at $x=0$.**

3. **Calculate the forces on a ball of radius $r$ floating in a tumbler of water with $h$ height of it under the water. If such a ball is pushed all the way down and released, will it ever jump out of the water surface.**
