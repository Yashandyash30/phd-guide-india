## **Interview Questions**

1. **You are given two energy states, $E_1$ and $E_2$, and a collection of fermions.**

   * The number of fermions is not fixed.
   * Calculate the number of microstates.
   * Then calculate the partition function.

2. **Now suppose that one energy level is 0 and the other is $E$:**

   * Calculate the partition function of the system in two cases:

     * (a) The fermions are spin-½
     * (b) The fermions are spin-polarized and spin-½

3. **Calculate the partition function and occupancy of the energy state $E$**

   * (for case (b): spin-polarized fermions)

4. **You are given two energy levels, 0 and $E$, and one fermion:**

   * What is the average energy of the system at

     * $T = 0 \, \text{K}$
     * $T \to \infty$

5. **Can you briefly explain how stars are formed?**

6. **Stars are formed from interstellar clouds.**

   * What conservation laws make these clouds so stable?

     * *(e.g., like Earth orbiting the Sun – not escaping or falling inward due to gravity)*

7. **Draw some wavefunctions (from ground state to excited states) of the 1D simple harmonic oscillator.**

8. **Draw the wavefunctions for a half harmonic oscillator:**

   * $x > 0$: motion is simple harmonic
   * $x < 0$: infinite potential barrier
