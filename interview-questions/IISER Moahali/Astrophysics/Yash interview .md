###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Astrophysics

## Interview Format:
**Number of Panel Members:** 5 
**Mode:** Offline-Inperson Interview  
**Rounds:** 1


## **Questions**

1. **Introduce yourself.**

   * What did you do during your gap year?
   * Why do you want to pursue a PhD in astrophysics?

2. **Questions related to the workshops I attended:**

   * What is a Lagrange point?
   * Draw the Lagrange points — which are stable and which aren't?
   * Write the equation showing how forces balance at the $L_1$ and $L_2$ Lagrange points.
   * What would be the trajectory of a satellite placed at the $L_1$ Lagrange point if the Sun suddenly vanished?

3. **Why, in the formula for the time period of Earth (in Kepler’s problem), is the distance taken from the center of the Sun?**

   * *(Hint: The center of mass is very close to the center of the Sun.)*

4. **What would happen if the Moon vanished?**

   * Would there be any effect on Earth’s trajectory around the Sun?
   * Would it still be a stable circular orbit?
   * What would happen to the tilt of the Earth?

5. **Is the three-body problem exactly solvable?**

6. **Draw the H–R Diagram.**

   * What do the different axes denote?
   * Where is the Sun located in the H–R Diagram?
   * The Sun is classified as a G2V star — what does this classification mean?
   * Why is the H–R Diagram important? What information can be inferred from it?
   * How does a star move in the H–R Diagram as it evolves?

     * *(Detailed discussion on mass ranges, various stages during the main sequence, and the star's end life cycle.)*

7. **Explain the concepts of Absolute Magnitude and Apparent Magnitude.**

8. **Write Maxwell’s equations.**

   * How would they change if magnetic monopoles existed?
