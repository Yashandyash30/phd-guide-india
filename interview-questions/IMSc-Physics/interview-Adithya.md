General trend â€” one question from quantum mechanics, one from classical/mathematical physics, one from statistical physics, one from electrodynamics.

##  Questions

1. **Given a two state system with Hamiltonian $H=|1\rangle\langle 2| + |2\rangle\langle1|$, find the time evolution of the state $|1\rangle$**

2. **For a complex function $1/(1-z)$, what are the poles, write its series expansion about origin, what is the region of convergance of the series, how would you expand this function about some other point outside this region.**

3. **Derive the density of states $g(E)$ for a Bosonic System in two dimensions, and conclude if Bose-Einstein Condensation is possible or not in two dimensions. Extend the discussion to one dimension case.**

4. **Write the Maxwell's equations in four vector form. Show that in charge free region, it reduces to a wave equation. Find its solutions, and show that the plane wave solutions are transversal.**
