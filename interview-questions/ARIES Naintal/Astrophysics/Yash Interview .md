# **PhD Physics Interview ARIES Nainital**

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Astrophysics

## Interview Format:
**Number of Panel Members:** 5  ( in first Committe ) & 6-7 ( in Second Committe)
**Mode:** Offline-Inperson Interview  
**Rounds:** 2 (conducted by two seperate panels of faculty members)


## **Committee 1**

1. **Introduce yourself.**

   * What did you do during your gap year?
   * What was your dissertation project in M.Sc.? *(Mine was in atmospheric physics related to atmospheric pollutants.)*
   * Asked various questions related to my dissertation project.

2. **Draw the Temperature–Height Profile of Earth’s atmosphere.**

3. **How much mass of the Solar System does the Sun consist of?**

   * Draw a mass distribution curve for our solar system.
   * Why does Kepler’s orbit give an almost exact description of planetary orbits in our solar system?

     * *(Since the mass of the Sun is so high, the problem can be simply solved using the two-body problem.)*
   * What would happen if the mass of the Sun were comparable to that of the planets?

4. **Write Maxwell’s equations.**

   * What is displacement current?
   * Explain by drawing a circuit diagram.

5. **How many equations are there in Maxwell’s equations?**

   * *(2 scalar equations and 6 vector equations, total being 8)*
   * How many unknowns are there?

     * *(6: 3 components of magnetic field and 3 components of electric field)*
   * Maxwell’s equations in differential form give 8 scalar equations, but we have only 6 unknowns.

     * Isn’t that an overdetermined system?

## **Committee 2**

1. **Introduce yourself.**

   * What did you do during your gap year?
   * In which topic do you want to do your PhD?

2. **Tell about the atmosphere of the Sun.**

   * Which layer is visible to us?

3. **What is the surface temperature of the Sun?**

   * How do we estimate its temperature?

     * *(Using Wien’s displacement law related to the blackbody radiation curve)*

4. **What are the different layers in Earth’s atmosphere?**

   * Draw the Temperature–Height Profile of Earth’s atmosphere.
   * Why does temperature decrease with altitude?
   * What is the source of heat — the Earth or the Sun?
   * Tell about the scale height.

     * Where does it come from?
     * What does it signify?

5. **Draw the H–R Diagram.**

   * What do the different axes denote?
   * Where is the Sun located in the H–R Diagram?
   * On the vertical axis, is it Apparent Magnitude or Absolute Magnitude?
   * What is the Absolute Magnitude of the Sun?
   * What is its Apparent Magnitude?
   * What is the difference between them?
   * How does a star move in the H–R Diagram as it evolves?

6. **Do you know about the thermonuclear reaction inside the core of the Sun?**

   * Write the p–p chain reaction with proper notation.
   * Why would two protons come close to form a deuteron even when they are repelled due to electrostatic repulsion?
   * Is gravitational pull enough to support this process?
   * Calculate the order of electrostatic potential and thermal kinetic energy.
   * Even when the order of thermal KE is keV and that of electrostatic potential is MeV, how can this reaction even be possible?

     * *(Not in classical sense, but possible in quantum sense because of quantum tunneling.)*

7. **Write the expression for tunneling probability / transmission coefficient.**
