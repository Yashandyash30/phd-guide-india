## **Questions**

1. **Introduce yourself.**

   * Have you done any project work?

2. **Briefly describe your project.**

   * How have you done the project?
   * Have you done any simulation?

3. **(Project-specific questions):**

   * What is the dimension of dust particles — their radius and mass?
   * How are the dust particles orbiting the Sun under gravitational force?
   * What is the typical mass of stars and what is the mass of a dust particle?
   * Can you guess the total mass of the dust particles that are orbiting the Sun?
   * How can you detect dust particles, or how can you say a region contains dust? Any method?

4. **What is the transmission coefficient?**

   * Write the formula.

5. **What is the unit of the transmission coefficient?**

6. **In the project, you calculate the cross-section of dust particles:**

   * Is it a classical or quantum cross-section?
   * How is the quantum cross-section different from the classical one?
   * Write down the formula for both classical and quantum cross-sections.
   * What actually happens in the quantum picture?

7. **Which experiments have you done in the nuclear physics lab?**

   * Which detector have you used for gamma spectroscopy and beta spectroscopy?

8. **Why do positive and negative beta decay happen?**

9. **Draw the spectrum for beta particle energy and the number of beta particles.**

10. **Why is the beta spectrum continuous while the gamma spectrum is discrete?**

11. **What is the difference between a scintillation detector and a GM counter?**

12. **Can you explain the difference between classical and quantum pictures?**

13. **Explain an experiment that demonstrates the wave nature of particles.**

* (Example: Young’s double slit experiment with electrons)
* What is happening in the experiment?
* If we observe electrons through a microscope, what nature of electrons do you see, and what happens through the double slit?
* When would you consider the wave nature of light, and when the particle nature?

14. **If there is a magnifying glass and a paper is kept below it in sunlight, the paper burns — explain what is happening here.**

* Why is light bending?
* Does light bend in gravity?
* Can you apply this phenomenon here or is something different happening?
* What property of the material bends light?
* Why does the change in velocity (when light enters a different medium) result in bending of light?

15. **In the project, you worked with drag force — explain what drag force is.**

* What happens to an object in a drag force medium?

16. **Suppose a mass $m$ is connected to a spring and hanging from the roof and is oscillating:**

* Write down the equation of motion.
* Solve the equation to find $x(t)$.
* Now, if the system is in a drag force medium, how does the equation of motion change?
* Plot the displacement of the mass with time for both cases.

17. **Explain what specific heat is.**

* Write down the formula.
* What is its unit?

18. **What are degrees of freedom?**

* How many types are there?
* For a diatomic molecule, how many rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom exist?
* What is the average energy associated with them?

19. **If two masses are connected with a spring, calculate the vibrational degrees of freedom.**

* *(Note: I answered "out-of-phase" vibration, but was told there is also something else — told to think about it later.)*

20. **Plot the following functions:**

* $\exp(x^2)$
* $\sin(1/x)$
