# IISER Bhopal - PhD Interview (Physics)

###  Year: 2025
###  Field: Theory

## Interview Format:
- **Number of Panel Members:** 3 (6 in the morning sess)  
- **Mode:** In-person Interview  
- **Rounds:** 1 

There are only general theory panels, and no specific hep-th/cond-th panels.

## Questions:
1. **Write the general wave equation. Explain how we can derive its solutions. Under what situations can one do the separation of variables.**

2. **Draw a infinite potential well, and its ground state wavefunction. Show that this state satisfies the uncertainty principle. Specifically, in this wavefunction, the energy is definite, i.e. $\Delta E = 0$. But $E = \frac{p^2}{2m}$ which should mean $p^2$ is definite. Given that the uncertainity in $x$ is finite, naively this breaks the uncertainty principle broken. Explain how the principle is rescued.**

3. **Draw the potential $V(x) = -\alpha x^2 + \beta x^4$. Derive the oscillation frequencies at the stable equilibrium points. Show that a similar analysis for the unstable equilibrium point breaks down.**
